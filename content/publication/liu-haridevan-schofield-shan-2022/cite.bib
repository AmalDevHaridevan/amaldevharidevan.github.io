 abstractnote = {Feature extraction or localization based on the ﬁducial marker could fail due to motion blur in real-world robotic applications. To solve this problem, a lightweight generative adversarial network, named Ghost-DeblurGAN, for real-time motion deblurring is developed in this paper. Furthermore, on account that there is no existing deblurring benchmark for such task, a new large-scale dataset, YorkTag, is proposed that provides pairs of sharp/blurred images containing ﬁducial markers. With the proposed model trained and tested on YorkTag, it is demonstrated that when applied along with ﬁducial marker systems to motion-blurred images, Ghost-DeblurGAN improves the marker detection signiﬁcantly. The datasets and codes used in this paper are available at: https://github.com/York-SDCNLab/Ghost-DeblurGAN.},
