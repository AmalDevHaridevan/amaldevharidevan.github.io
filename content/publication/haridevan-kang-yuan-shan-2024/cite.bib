 abstractnote = {This paper introduces ROS2Gazebo Drone, a modular C++ and Python based toolbox based on ROS2 and Gazebo. ROS2GazeboDrone consists of a core module written as a Gazebo System Plugin, that orchestrates the interfaces between Gazebo and Quadrotor. The modular design of toolbox can be used to test perception, path planning, and control algorithms in an efficient manner. The toolbox can be integrated as a ROS2 node as well as a standalone quadrotor simulator. The decoupled and modular architecture enables the extension of this toolbox to any quadrotor model with minimal modifications. We demonstrate the flexibility of our toolbox through demonstrations.},
