      I had the oppurtunity to work with Dr. Jinjun Shan and Dr. Yibo Liu on the project "Developing light-weight Convolutional Neural Networks to perform real-time deblurring on Autonomous vehicles". 
      We produced a publication named Application of Ghost-DeblurGAN to fiducial marker detection, IROS 2022 as part of this research. I was responsible for tetsing various neural network architectures and performing benchmarking among them.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing MSc Degree from York University on Autonomous Systems. Specifically, my research interests revolve around simulators and their applications in Dynamics & Control, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for qu8adrotors. Currently I am working on a research project on the use of Deep Neural Networks to perrform localization, through SLAM or VIO.
